Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/vercel/path0/.next/server/app/(WebsiteLayout)/page_client-reference-manifest.js'

PROMPT: in this project please find file that doesnt do anything. It has never been called or use.

src/app/(WebsiteLayout)/page.tsx - This file only contains a redirect to '/' and is marked as "just a placeholder to prevent routing conflicts". It doesn't provide any real functionality.

I found the problem: I have a page.js file in src/app/(main)/(pages)/page.js

This page does not do anything... not sure why it's even there, but for anyone else facing this error, check for useless page.js files in route groups
