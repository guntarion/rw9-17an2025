# Next.js 15 Async Route Parameters

## Overview

This document explains a warning encountered in Next.js 15 related to synchronous access of dynamic route parameters, why it occurred, and how it was resolved.

## The Problem

When running the application, we encountered the following warning:

```
[next-auth][warn][DEBUG_ENABLED]
https://next-auth.js.org/warnings#debug_enabled
Error: Route "/api/innovation-paper/[id]" used `params.id`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties.

```

This warning appeared in our API route handlers where we were accessing dynamic route parameters (params) synchronously.

## Root Cause

In Next.js 15, dynamic APIs including route parameters (`params`) have been made asynchronous. This change is part of Next.js's efforts to improve performance and reliability by making dynamic data access more consistent.

### Original Implementation

Our route handlers were directly accessing the params object's properties:

```typescript
export async function GET(req: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  // Direct synchronous access of params.id
  const id = params.id;
  // ...
}
```

### The Issue

Next.js 15 requires that params be treated as a Promise that needs to be awaited before accessing its properties. The synchronous access pattern used in our code could lead to race conditions or inconsistent behavior in certain scenarios.

## The Solution

We resolved this issue by properly awaiting the params object before accessing its properties:

```typescript
export async function GET(req: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  // Properly await params before accessing properties
  const { id } = await params;
  // ...
}
```

The fix was applied to all route handlers in the affected file:

- GET handler
- PUT handler
- DELETE handler

## Implementation Details

The changes involved:

1. **Identifying affected files**: We located all route handlers using dynamic route parameters.

2. **Updating parameter access**: Modified the code to await the params object before accessing its properties.

3. **Maintaining type safety**: Kept TypeScript type definitions while updating the access pattern.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Breaking Changes in Framework Updates**: Even minor version updates in Next.js can introduce changes in how core APIs should be accessed.

2. **Async Data Access**: Next.js is moving towards more consistent async patterns for dynamic data access.

3. **Documentation Importance**: Framework documentation and warning messages provide valuable guidance for proper implementation patterns.

## Future Considerations

1. **Audit Dynamic Routes**: Regularly audit route handlers to ensure they follow current best practices for parameter access.

2. **Migration Planning**: When upgrading Next.js versions, review all dynamic route handlers for compatibility with new async patterns.

3. **Type Safety**: Consider creating utility functions or types to enforce proper async parameter access patterns across the application.
