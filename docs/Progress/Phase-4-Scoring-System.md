## Files to Create
- [ ] `src/app/judge/login/page.tsx`
- [ ] `src/app/judge/dashboard/page.tsx`
- [ ] `src/app/judge/score/[competition]/page.tsx`
- [ ] `src/app/results/page.tsx`

## Database Schema Requirements
```typescript
// Judge authentication
interface Judge {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  competitions: string[];
  isActive: boolean;
}

// Scoring data
interface Score {
  id: string;
  competitionId: string;
  participantId: string;
  judgeId: string;
  criteria: Record<string, number>;
  totalScore: number;
  submittedAt: Date;
}

// Competition results
interface Result {
  competitionId: string;
  rankings: {
    participantId: string;
    totalScore: number;
    rank: number;
  }[];
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```
