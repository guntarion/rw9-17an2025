Help me build the functionality I ask you by using Desktop Commander MCP. You must check any existing implementation if there's any. You must create a page view according to the existing one. You can see an example at /Users/guntar/Codes/PROJECTS/ASET/front-asset-mgmt/src/app/(DashboardLayout)/sample-page/page.tsx

Notice that this project is a next.js ("next": "^15.2.0", "react": "^18.2.0",) with tailwind and shadcn/ui. You can check the components at /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/uniform-mgmt/src/components/ui and you may suggest additional components if needed.
